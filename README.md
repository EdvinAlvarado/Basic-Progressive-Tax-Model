# Basic Progressive Tax Model

This was made on the fly partly to see if I could and partly to easily show my argument that progressive tax is economically the correct tax model. That is not saying it is perfect but that it is better than flat tax model. This is obviously not well researched as there are no citation. However, I did apply my knowledge learned from Intro of Microeconomics and Microeconomics Theory classes with the well accepted fact that goods ans services behave with decreasing marginal utility. Money is no different.

### Miscelleneous

The abbrivation are in spanish as that is how I learned them.
